# Askyblock & AcidIsland Issues
This repository is for handling issues related to ASkyBlock or AcidIsland.

## Feature Requests
Create an issue to submit a feature request. Before you do, check the closed issues - maybe it was already submitted.
Even though your idea may be awesome, we may not choose to do it. You can always fork the code and do it yourself if that happens.
We will try to give you a decision on whether we will do a feature or not within about a week of submission. Here are a few possible reasons for why we will not do it:

* It's a rubbish idea - sorry, sometimes they are.
* It'll make the plugin too big, or make game play too complex - remember a lot of players are not even in their teens
* The idea will change the game too much, e.g., make it SkyWars, instead of SkyBlock
* It will cause support issues for admins
* It will add lag
* It's too big a job and we don't have the time or the resources to do it
* Etc.

We reserve the right not to give a reason. Again, you can always fork the code.
